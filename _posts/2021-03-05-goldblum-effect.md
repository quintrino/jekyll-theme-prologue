_You were so caught up with whether or not you could you didn't stop to think about whether you should_

This line always stands out to me in Jurassic Park, when it's spoken by Ian Malcolm (played by Jeff Goldblum).

I've now started to use this as a representation for when the potential of achieving something overwhelms the actual evaluative process of whether it's worthwhile in the first place.

I think I sometimes slip into this tendency myself, when I become more focused on how I could achieve a particular outcome, I can sometimes become blinded to whether or not the ultimate objective of it is worth it or not.

I remember when coming up with my plan to win the [Trivia Grand Final](https://nickwolf.com.au/blog/trivial-for-some) I got pushback from my friend Richard that my plan would actually result in a very strong negative reaction from the rest of the competitors.

I had been so focused on whether or not I would actually be able to win, that I hadn't even considered other people's reactions and whether that was reason enough to stop from attempting it. Thankfully, I found a solution, but I most definitely won't have even considered it without Richard's insight.

The lesson from this is when your brain gets caught up on figuring out how to do a particular thing, it's good to include a step in your thinking process to ask yourself, _should I be doing this at all?_
