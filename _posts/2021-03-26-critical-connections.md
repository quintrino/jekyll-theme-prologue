I'm particularly looking forward to the vaccine rolling out simply because of how much I miss in-person interaction.

Recently I've had the chance to go to a few multi person events (remote but still with many people), as opposed to endless phone calls and it's made me realise just how much I enjoy meeting new people.

Hopefully once we have a better grasp on the vaccine and something approaching herd immunity I'll have the chance to do that again in person.

I have however noticed that when I've seen larger groups of people recently I still find myself reserved and cautious. While I think this is somewhat reasonable for the moment while I don't have the vaccine, I have reflected on how I plan to rewrite my brain's concerns when there's greater vaccine roll out.

I've been thinking about what are the best events to try and max out my people experience.

* Free Hugs events
* Music Festivals
* Mosh pits
* Chadstone Christmas
* Crowd surfing


Ultimately once I have the vaccine it will be interesting to see how quickly I can rewire my crowd attitudes.

I'm aware we're a while away yet, but I look forward to it.
Both the experiment itself and just to be reconnecting once again.
