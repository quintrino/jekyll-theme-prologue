One of the things that made [SYN](https://nickwolf.com.au/blog/synning-in-style) both innovative and ephemeral is it's age limit.

Being a _Youth_ radio station meant that you only had so many years.

Once you hit 26 you were officially retired from active volunteering.

This was _unofficially_ referred to as SYN dying.

This would occasionally lead to overheard snippets of conversations having a very morbid spin. "Oh I'm dying soon", "Oh I'll be dead by then" "Wait! When did you die?"

While I was very saddened for my time at SYN to finish I did take the opportunity to embrace my dramatic side for my 26th birthday.

My 26th Birthday party was Funeral themed. Everyone was required to come in black tie, I had 2 eulogies, 1 from a close friend and one from a fake widow. It even culminated in my lying down and people saying their final words to me.

Overall it proved a fun and very symbolic way to say goodbye to such an important part of my life.

I think there are many times in which we celebrate the beginning of something, but it is rarer that we celebrate the end of something joyful.
